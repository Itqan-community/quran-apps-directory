# US1.1: Database Technology Selection

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Database Architecture Foundation  
**Sprint:** Week 1, Day 1-2  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** P1 (Critical)  
**Assigned To:** Database Architect  
**Status:** Not Started

---

## üìã User Story

**As a** Database Architect  
**I want to** evaluate and select the optimal database technology for the Quran Apps Directory  
**So that** we have a solid foundation that supports current data (44 apps, 11 categories) and future growth with excellent performance and reliability

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Technology Evaluation Completed
- [ ] Evaluated at least 3 database options (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Documented pros/cons for each option
- [ ] Comparison matrix created with scoring criteria:
  - Performance (query speed, write speed)
  - Scalability (horizontal, vertical)
  - Data integrity (ACID compliance)
  - .NET integration quality
  - Community support & documentation
  - Cost (hosting, licensing)
- [ ] Team review conducted with stakeholders

### AC2: PostgreSQL Selected and Justified
- [ ] PostgreSQL 16+ selected as primary database
- [ ] Technical justification document created including:
  - ACID compliance for data integrity
  - Excellent JSON/JSONB support for flexible fields
  - Mature .NET integration via Npgsql
  - Proven scalability (handles millions of records)
  - Rich indexing capabilities (B-tree, GiST, GIN)
  - Strong community and enterprise support
- [ ] Cost analysis completed (Railway vs Digital Ocean)

### AC3: Development Instance Setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL 16+ installed on development machine
- [ ] Database server configured with optimal settings
- [ ] Connection tested from .NET 9 application
- [ ] Basic admin tools configured (pgAdmin/DBeaver)
- [ ] Backup strategy outlined

### AC4: Database Hosting Decision
- [ ] Hosting platform selected (Railway or Digital Ocean)
- [ ] Free tier/paid plan evaluated
- [ ] Connection pooling strategy defined
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plan documented

### AC5: Team Onboarding
- [ ] Team briefed on PostgreSQL decision
- [ ] Quick start guide created for developers
- [ ] Connection string format documented
- [ ] Environment variables strategy defined

## üìù Technical Notes

### .NET 9 Integration
```csharp
// NuGet Package
Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL 9.0.0

// Connection String Format
"Host=localhost;Database=quran_apps;Username=postgres;Password=***"

// appsettings.json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=quran_apps;Username=postgres;Password=***;Pooling=true;Minimum Pool Size=5;Maximum Pool Size=100"
  }
}
```

### PostgreSQL Version Requirements
- **Minimum:** PostgreSQL 16.0
- **Recommended:** PostgreSQL 16.2+ (latest patch)
- **Features Utilized:**
  - JSONB for flexible fields
  - Full-text search capabilities
  - GIN indexes for array/JSONB fields
  - Row-level security (future auth feature)

### Hosting Comparison
| Feature | Railway | Digital Ocean |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Free Tier | $5/month (512MB) | $15/month (1GB) |
| Managed | Yes | Yes |
| Backups | Automatic daily | Manual + paid auto |
| Scaling | Easy (UI-based) | Moderate (CLI) |
| .NET Support | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Recommendation** | ‚úÖ Railway (simpler, cheaper for MVP) | Future migration for scale |
