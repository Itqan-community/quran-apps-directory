# US1.2: Design Complete Relational Schema

## 🎯 User Story
**As a database architect, I want to design a complete relational schema for the Quran Apps Directory so that all data relationships are properly modeled and scalable.**

## 📋 Description
Create detailed database schema including all tables, relationships, indexes, and constraints based on the existing applicationsData.ts structure and future requirements.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All entities identified (Apps, Categories, Features, Developers, Screenshots)
- [ ] Primary and foreign keys defined for all tables
- [ ] Many-to-many relationships modeled (apps-categories, apps-features)
- [ ] Indexes created for common query patterns (search, filtering)
- [ ] Constraints and data types validated
- [ ] ERD diagram created and documented
- [ ] Schema supports 10x growth from current 44 apps

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation
- [ ] Analyze applicationsData.ts for all data fields and types
- [ ] Design tables: apps, categories, app_categories, features, app_features, developers, screenshots
- [ ] Define relationships: app -> developer (1:1), app -> category (M:N), app -> feature (M:N)
- [ ] Create Prisma schema file with all models
- [ ] Generate ERD using dbdiagram.io or similar tool
- [ ] Document schema decisions and rationale
