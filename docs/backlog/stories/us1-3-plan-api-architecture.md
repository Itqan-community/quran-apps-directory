# US1.3: Plan API Architecture

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Database Architecture Foundation  
**Sprint:** Week 1, Day 2-3  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** P1 (Critical)  
**Assigned To:** Backend Architect  
**Status:** Not Started

---

## 📋 User Story

**As a** Backend Architect  
**I want to** design a comprehensive RESTful API architecture  
**So that** the Angular frontend and future clients can interact with the database through well-defined, secure, and performant endpoints

---

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: API Design Principles Defined
- [ ] RESTful design principles documented
- [ ] Resource naming conventions established (e.g., `/api/v1/apps`, `/api/v1/categories`)
- [ ] HTTP verbs usage defined (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- [ ] Response format standardized (JSON with consistent structure)
- [ ] Error response format defined with status codes
- [ ] API versioning strategy documented (v1, v2, etc.)

### AC2: Complete Endpoint Specification
- [ ] All endpoints documented in OpenAPI/drf-spectacular format:
  ```
  Apps Endpoints:
  - GET    /api/v1/apps (list with pagination & filtering)
  - GET    /api/v1/apps/{id} (single app details)
  - POST   /api/v1/apps (create - admin only)
  - PUT    /api/v1/apps/{id} (update - admin only)
  - DELETE /api/v1/apps/{id} (delete - admin only)
  - GET    /api/v1/apps/search (advanced search)
  
  Categories Endpoints:
  - GET    /api/v1/categories (list all)
  - GET    /api/v1/categories/{id} (single category)
  - GET    /api/v1/categories/{id}/apps (apps in category)
  
  Developers Endpoints:
  - GET    /api/v1/developers (list all)
  - GET    /api/v1/developers/{id} (single developer)
  - GET    /api/v1/developers/{id}/apps (apps by developer)
  ```
- [ ] Request/response DTOs defined for each endpoint

### AC3: Authentication Strategy Planned
- [ ] JWT token-based authentication designed
- [ ] Token structure defined (claims, expiration, refresh strategy)
- [ ] Role-based access control planned (Admin, Developer, User, Anonymous)
- [ ] Endpoint permissions matrix created
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism designed

### AC4: Rate Limiting Strategy
- [ ] Rate limiting rules defined per endpoint category:
  - Anonymous: 100 requests/hour
  - Authenticated: 1000 requests/hour
  - Admin: Unlimited
- [ ] Rate limiting middleware strategy planned
- [ ] Response headers for rate limit info defined
- [ ] Graceful degradation plan for exceeded limits

### AC5: Performance Requirements
- [ ] Target response times defined:
  - List endpoints: <100ms (P95)
  - Detail endpoints: <50ms (P95)
  - Search endpoints: <200ms (P95)
- [ ] Caching strategy outlined (Redis for future)
- [ ] Database query optimization guidelines
- [ ] Connection pooling strategy defined

### AC6: Security Measures
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement strategy
- [ ] CORS policy defined (whitelist frontend domains)
- [ ] Input validation requirements documented
- [ ] SQL injection prevention strategy (Django ORM parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention measures
- [ ] API key management for public API (future)

### AC7: API Documentation Plan
- [ ] drf-spectacular/OpenAPI 3.0 adoption confirmed
- [ ] Auto-generation from code docstrings planned
- [ ] Example requests/responses included
- [ ] Authentication flow documented
- [ ] Error codes and messages catalogued

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Django REST Framework ViewSet Pattern
```python
from rest_framework import viewsets, status
from rest_framework.decorators import action
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination
from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
from rest_framework.filters import SearchFilter, OrderingFilter

class StandardResultsSetPagination(PageNumberPagination):
    page_size = 20
    page_size_query_param = 'page_size'
    max_page_size = 100

class AppsViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    Retrieves a paginated list of Quran applications with filtering and search.

    Query Parameters:
    - page: Page number (default: 1)
    - page_size: Items per page (default: 20, max: 100)
    - category_id: Filter by category (optional)
    """
    queryset = App.objects.all()
    serializer_class = AppSerializer
    pagination_class = StandardResultsSetPagination
    filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend, SearchFilter, OrderingFilter]
    filterset_fields = ['category', 'status']
    search_fields = ['name_en', 'name_ar']
    ordering_fields = ['created_at', 'apps_avg_rating']

    def get_queryset(self):
        """Filter apps based on permissions and query parameters"""
        queryset = App.objects.all()
        # Additional filtering logic
        return queryset
```

### Standard Response Format
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "totalCount": 100,
    "totalPages": 5
  },
  "links": {
    "first": "/api/v1/apps?page=1",
    "prev": null,
    "next": "/api/v1/apps?page=2",
    "last": "/api/v1/apps?page=5"
  }
}
```

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid request parameters",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "pageSize",
        "message": "Page size must be between 1 and 100"
      }
    ]
  },
  "traceId": "00-abc123-def456-00"
}
```
