# Quran Apps Directory Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap sequences the "new moon" labeled GitHub issues into logical development phases, prioritizing foundation (database/backend) before user-facing features. Phases are ordered by dependencies: architecture → infrastructure → migration → API → integration → enhancements.

Prioritization uses numerical labels (1-5):
- **Priority 1**: Critical foundation (blocking for all others).
- **Priority 2**: High-impact core (enables functionality).
- **Priority 3**: Medium enhancements (improves UX).
- **Priority 4**: Low optimizations (polish).
- **Priority 5**: Future/low-impact (ecosystem).

Estimated timeline: 8-12 weeks for MVP (Phases 1-4), assuming 2-3 sprints per phase.

## Phase 1: Database Architecture Foundation (Weeks 1-2, Priority 1)

  - US3.2: Transform Data (# new story) - Schema mapping.
  - US3.3: Automated Migration Scripts (# new story) - ETL with validation.
  - US3.4: Integrity Validation (# new story) - Post-migration checks.
  - US3.5: Handle Relationships (# new story) - Many-to-many (apps-categories).

- **Epic: Data Migration & Integrity** (#154)

## Phase 4: API Development & Integration (Weeks 7-8, Priority 2)
Focus: Build CRUD APIs. Dependencies: Phases 1-3.

- **Epic 4: API Development & Integration** (#149)
  - US4.1: CRUD Endpoints (# new story) - Apps, categories.
  - US4.2: Advanced Filtering (# new story) - By features/languages.
  - US4.3: Pagination (# new story) - For large results.
  - US4.4: Error Handling (# new story) - Logging/retry.
  - US4.5: API Documentation (# new story) - Swagger/OpenAPI.

## Phase 5: Frontend Integration (Weeks 9-10, Priority 2)
Focus: Connect Angular to APIs. Dependencies: Phase 4.

- **Epic: Frontend Integration** (#156)
  - US5.1: Replace Static Imports (# new story) - HTTP client services.
  - US5.2: Update Angular Services (# new story) - API calls.
  - US5.3: Loading/Error States (# new story) - UX feedback.
  - US5.4: Caching Implementation (# new story) - Local storage.
  - US5.5: Performance Optimization (# new story) - Lazy loading.

## Phase 6: Enhanced App Discovery (Weeks 11-12, Priority 3)
Focus: Advanced search. Dependencies: Phases 4-5.

- **Epic: Advanced Search System** (#135)
  - US1.1: Search by Mushaf Types (#136)
  - US1.2: Search by Rewayah (#137)
  - US1.3: Search by Languages (#138)
  - US1.4: Search by Target Audience (#139)

- **Epic: Enhanced App Discovery** (#142)

## Phase 7: Social Sharing & Community (Post-MVP, Priority 4)
Focus: Engagement features. Dependencies: Phases 4-5.

- **Epic: Social Sharing & Community Features** (#140)
  - US2.1: Share Button Implementation (#141)

## Phase 8: Optimizations & Ecosystem (Future, Priority 4-5)
Focus: Polish and expansion.

- **Epic: SEO & Performance Optimization** (#143)
- **Epic: Developer Ecosystem Integration** (#144)
- **Epic: Content Management & Quality Assurance** (#145)

## Milestones
- **MVP (Week 8)**: Database migrated, basic API, frontend connected.
- **Beta (Week 12)**: Advanced search live, sharing functional.
- **1.0 Release (Week 16)**: Full optimizations, ecosystem features.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Cross-phase: Backend must precede frontend.
- Risk: Migration data loss - Mitigate with backups/validation.
- Monitoring: Weekly sprint reviews.

This roadmap ensures logical progression, minimizing rework.
