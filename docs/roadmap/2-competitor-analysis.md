*Owner: Abubakr Abduraghman, a.abduraghman@itqan.dev*

## Objective
Benchmark our directory against leading Quran-related apps and platforms so we can sharpen our product roadmap and messaging. (Rechecked October 2025 with focus on directory-style competitors.)

## Quran-Only Directories (Direct Competitors)
| Directory                          | Type                           | Key Features                                                                                                                                                             | Link |

- **Comprehensive Rubric:** Beyond simple categories (app.qw.sa), we evaluate across 5 pillars with evidence-based scoring.
- **Interactivity & Tools:** Static catalogues (guidetoquran.com, equran.me) lack comparison features - we offer side-by-side analysis.
- **Community-Driven Reviews:** More structured than user ratings (Uptodown), with verified reviewer process and ongoing updates.
- **Trust & Transparency:** Clear criteria, last-verified dates, privacy badges - addressing gaps in existing directories.

## Directory-Specific Gaps
| Competitor | Directory Features | Limitations | Our Differentiation |
| - | - | - | - |
| **IslamicFinder Apps** | Basic categories, search, some reviews | Limited to popular apps, no deep comparisons | 5-pillar rubric + side-by-side compare |
| **MuslimApp Directory** | App listings with ratings | Ads-heavy, no curation process | Community reviews + trust badges |
| **Product Hunt Quran** | User-voted collections | Not Quran-specific, temporary lists | Permanent, verified directory with filters |

## Strengths of Competitors
1. **Comprehensive Features** – Super-apps cover prayer times, Qibla and social features, leading to daily stickiness.
2. **Massive Reach** – Muslim Pro & Quran Majeed boast tens of millions of downloads, giving them brand recall.
3. **Polished UX & Localisation** – Multiple languages and reciters serve global audiences.

## Weaknesses & Gaps We Can Exploit
| Gap | Why It Matters | Our Advantage |
| - | - | - |
| **Opaque Quality** | Users rely on star ratings that overlook accuracy/privacy | Transparent 5-pillar rubric & review evidence |
| **Overload of Choice** | Hundreds of similar apps with no guidance | Opinionated filters & side-by-side compare |
| **Privacy Concerns** | Ad-heavy monetisation erodes trust | Ads-free directory, trust badges |
| **Out-of-Date Info** | App store copy may be stale | Community review cadence + last-verified tag |

## Strategic Opportunities (Next 90 Days)
1. **Opinionated Filters 2.0** – Help users bypass feature bloat of super-apps.
2. **Side-by-Side Compare** – Unique differentiator; no competitor offers neutral comparison.
3. **Favorites & Shareable Lists** – Turn our niche expertise into viral, curated collections.
4. **Developer Submission Pipeline** – Convert competing app devs into platform partners.

## Positioning Statement
> *“The Qur'an Apps Directory is the **TripAdvisor for Quran apps** – an independent, community-powered guide that helps you pick the right app in under two minutes.”*

By focusing on **trust, curation, and decision speed**, we occupy a clear white-space between noisy app stores and monolithic super-apps.
